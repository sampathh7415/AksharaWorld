## Technical Directives For Sam
1. **Scope Locking**: Do not look at or edit any code files outside of the "Target Files" list unless they are read-only dependencies needed for compilation.
2. **Defensive Pathing**: Ensure any dynamic load, require, or import uses relative paths (`./` or `../`) and does not hardcode drive prefixes (`C:\` or `G:\`).
3. **Vanilla Styles**: Use existing theme rules or create scoped vanilla CSS files. Do not import third-party CSS frameworks.
